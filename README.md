# Welcome to Project Starkiller!

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). The goal of this project is to provide a sample application using a USWDS 3.0 based Design System which is built in React with TypeScript. The project contains a component library (called Starkiller), a storybook implementation of that library, and a sample React applicaton. Any updates made to the library will automatically be reflected in the sample application.

Note: the sample application is intended to provide a starting point for building apps using the USWDS react components.

## Getting Started

- `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
- `npm run storybook` to load up the Design System.
- `npm run start` to load up the sample application.

## Other Useful Commands

- `npm run test` to run unit tests on the library and sample application.
- `npm run lint` to run linting checks on the library and sample application.
